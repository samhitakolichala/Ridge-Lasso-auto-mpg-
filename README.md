**Auto MPG Dataset Analysis**

**Overview**

The Auto MPG dataset contains information about fuel consumption and performance of various cars, as well as the characteristics of the cars themselves. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset using Ridge and Lasso regression techniques, and to predict the fuel consumption of cars based on their characteristics.

**Dataset Description**

The Auto MPG dataset contains 398 instances and 8 attributes, including:

mpg: miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
cylinders: number of cylinders in the engine
displacement: engine displacement (in cubic inches)
horsepower: horsepower of the engine
weight: weight of the car (in pounds)
acceleration: acceleration of the car (in seconds)
model year: year the car was produced
origin: origin of the car (1=USA, 2=Europe, 3=Japan)
The dataset is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded here.

**Methodology**

The Ridge and Lasso regression techniques were used to model the relationship between the fuel efficiency of cars and their characteristics. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. The models were trained on the training set and tested on the testing set.

The models were evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) metric, which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values of MSE indicate better model performance.

**Results**

The Ridge regression model achieved an MSE of 15.58 on the testing set, while the Lasso regression model achieved an MSE of 15.68. The Ridge model performed slightly better than the Lasso model, but both models achieved similar performance.

The analysis showed that the weight of the car was the most important predictor of fuel efficiency, followed by the horsepower and displacement of the engine.

**Conclusion**
The Ridge and Lasso regression techniques were successfully applied to the Auto MPG dataset, and were able to predict the fuel efficiency of cars based on their characteristics. The analysis showed that the weight, horsepower, and displacement of the engine were the most important predictors of fuel efficiency. This information can be used by car manufacturers to design more fuel-efficient cars, and by consumers to make informed decisions about which cars to purchase.
